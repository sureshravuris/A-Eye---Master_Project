# A-Eye: Master Project - Eye Disease Detection

This project focuses on detecting eye diseases using deep learning. The model has been trained on medical images and can be used to classify and analyze test images.

## üöÄ How to Run This Project

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/sureshravuris/A-Eye---Master_Project.git
cd eye-disease-detection
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up the Virtual Environment
```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Download the Dataset
The dataset is not included in this repository due to size constraints. You can download it from the following link:
[Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/ocular-disease-recognition-odir5k)

After downloading, place the dataset inside the `data/` folder.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Train the Model
```sh
python model_training.py
```
This will train the model and save the best-performing model as `best_model.pth`.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Test the Model
To run inference on a test image:
```sh
python test_model.py --image test_images/sample_image.png
```
This will output the predicted result.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation
To visualize the training process:
```sh
python data_exploration.py
```
This script generates insights and statistics about the dataset.
